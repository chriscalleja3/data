  Indicator is linked to Target 5.6 (Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and 
  reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International 
  Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome 
  documents of their review conferences) because reductions in adolescent childbearing that are brought 
  about by increasing access to sexual and reproductive health-care services are also reflective of 
  improvements in sexual and reproductive health and the exercise of reproductive rights per se. This 
  indicator is linked to Target 17.19 (By 2030 build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of 
  progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product and support statistical 
  capacity-building in developing countries) because the estimates of the adolescent birth rate are based in part on birth 
  registration and census data. Strengthened civil registration and vital statistics systems reaching universal
  coverage of birth registration and conducting at least one census every 10 years are directly relevant for 
  measuring progress on target 3.7.
